# authenticity.txt — Minimal Public Authenticity Protocol

authenticity.txt is a simple, text-only file placed at the root of any website or project to declare how published content was created: by humans, AI systems, or a mix of both. All declarations must be objectively verifiable by anyone. The protocol is technology-neutral, organization-neutral, identity-neutral, and fully open.

## Specification (v0.1)

The authenticity.txt file must follow seven universal rules:

1. File Location  
A plain UTF-8 text file named `authenticity.txt` must exist at the root of the domain or project (for example: `https://example.com/authenticity.txt` or `/authenticity.txt` in a repository).

2. Format  
The file must contain one declaration per line using the format:

`key: value`

Keys are lowercase ASCII with optional hyphens (`a-z0-9-`). Values are human-readable statements.

3. Scope Declaration  
The file must declare what it applies to using a `scope:` field, for example:

- `scope: whole-site` → applies to all content on the domain  
- `scope: section /blog` → applies to a path or section  
- `scope: page https://example.com/article.html` → applies to a specific page or asset

The scope must be precise enough for an independent third party to understand what content is covered.

4. Origin Declaration  
The file must declare the origin of the covered content using one of the following values:

- `origin: human`  
- `origin: ai`  
- `origin: mixed`

If AI is involved (`origin: ai` or `origin: mixed`), the file must also declare:

- `ai-system:` (e.g. model family or provider)  
- `ai-role:` (e.g. draft, assist, translate, summarize, generate-media)

If humans are involved (`origin: human` or `origin: mixed`), the file must declare at minimum:

- `human-role:` (e.g. author, editor, reviewer)

No personal identifiers (names, emails, IPs) are required or recommended.

5. Time & Revision  
The file should declare when the content covered by the scope was first created and last materially updated:

- `created:` ISO 8601 date or datetime (e.g. `2025-11-29T20:31:00Z`)  
- `last-updated:` ISO 8601 date or datetime

These timestamps must be consistent with any visible dates on the site (for example, article dates or release notes).

6. Verifiability  
Every declaration in authenticity.txt must be objectively verifiable by any independent third party. Examples of verifiable checks include:

- visible AI-origin notices on relevant pages  
- internal or public change logs  
- consistent dates between authenticity.txt and page metadata  
- publicly documented use of the declared AI systems  
- absence of contradictions (for example: `origin: human` while the page clearly declares “Generated by AI”).

Statements that cannot be reasonably verified by observation, documentation, or independent inspection must not be included.

7. Proof of Integrity  
The file must include a `sha256:` field containing the SHA-256 hash of the authenticity.txt file itself, computed over the exact bytes served:

`sha256: <SHA-256 hash of authenticity.txt>`

Accessing authenticity.txt must not require cookies, JavaScript, authentication, or redirects. It must be served as plain text over HTTPS.

## Example authenticity.txt file

scope: page https://example.com/blog/ai-announcement.html  
origin: mixed  
ai-system: large-language-model (family)  
ai-role: draft, translation  
human-role: editor, reviewer  
created: 2025-11-29T20:31:00Z  
last-updated: 2025-11-30T09:12:00Z  
notes: human-approved before publication; AI used for initial draft and language polish  
sha256: (to be computed)

## How to Verify

Anyone can verify an authenticity.txt file using any SHA-256 tool and basic inspection. The steps are universal:

1. Download the file from the root of the domain, for example:  
   `https://example.com/authenticity.txt`
2. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded file using any local or online tool.
3. Compare the computed value with the `sha256:` field published inside authenticity.txt. They must match exactly. If they do not match, the file is not self-consistent.
4. Check the `scope:` field and confirm that it clearly describes which content is covered (site-wide, section, or specific page).
5. Check the `origin:` field and any related fields:
   - If `origin: human` → the content should not be presented as AI-generated.  
   - If `origin: ai` or `origin: mixed` → AI use should be openly disclosed where relevant (labels, footers, or metadata).  
   - `ai-system:` and `ai-role:` should be consistent with public documentation or visible usage.  
   - `human-role:` should be compatible with how the site describes human involvement.
6. Check `created:` and `last-updated:` against visible dates on the site (article headers, changelog entries, release notes). They must not contradict what is publicly shown.
7. Confirm that accessing authenticity.txt does not set cookies, require JavaScript, authentication, or redirects. If it does, the file is considered non-compliant with this specification.

If any declaration cannot be reasonably verified or is clearly contradicted by the site, the implementation of authenticity.txt on that domain should be treated as non-compliant.

## Optional Tools for SHA-256 Verification

You may use any independent tool you trust to compute or validate SHA-256 hashes. Examples include:

Local verification tools:  
- `sha256sum` (Linux, macOS)  
- `shasum -a 256` (Linux, macOS)  
- `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` (Windows PowerShell)

Independent online verifiers:  
- https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis  
- https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html  
- https://hash.expert  

Automated public verifiers (optional):  
- https://api.timeproofs.io/api/verify?hash=<SHA256>

All methods must produce the same SHA-256 value published in the `sha256:` field of authenticity.txt.

## Related Open Integrity Standards (optional)

This protocol can be used alongside other public, neutral standards that support transparency and trust online, such as:

- integrity.txt — public integrity and tracking commitments  
- rights.txt — public declarations of digital rights and usage  
- explainable-ia.txt — public AI explainability commitments  
- TimeProofs — optional independent timestamp verification for any file or declaration

These standards are independent and can be implemented separately.
